# Behavioural design patterns workshop

Software development design patterns can be broadly separated into a few main groups*:

1. Behavioural

Describe the interactions between software components and how they communicate with each other.  They can help to simplify complex control flows by emphasising their interconnections.

2. Creational

Creational patterns are used to simplify the mechanisms for creating instances of objects and their hierarchies.

3. Structural

Rather than providing specific implementations or interfaces used to simplify software architectures; structural design patterns place an emphasis on the composition of larger structures from smaller components to realize new functionality.


The purpose of this workshop is to explore a few different, but related design patterns from the first of these camps.  There're a bunch of unit tests used to demonstrate some worked examples of:

* The Chain of Responsibility pattern
* The Mediator pattern
* The Command pattern.
